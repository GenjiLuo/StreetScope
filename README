========== July 2013 - streetview project ==========

The streetview project has 3 components, each in its own directory:

- fcgi: the web service that we run on an Amazon Elastic Cloud instance
- mongo: C++ wrappers for a MongoDB instance that stores our panorama metadata and tags
- webclient: our WebGL-based 3D tagging web app

For more information on each, see the README files located in each directory.

The legacy directory contains old code that is no longer used but may be helpful for historical/reference reasons.


========== Building ==========

The database and web service are written in C++, compliant with the 2011 standard.
Makefiles are included that attempt to build these projects using g++.
Make sure that you have a recent version of g++ (g++-4.7 as of June 30, 2012),
as older versions don't recognize some necessary c++11 features.
There are also a few places where you may have to change hardcoded paths.
These places are listed in the directory specific READMEs.
