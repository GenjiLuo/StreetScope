========== June 2012 - streetview project ==========

The streetview project currently has 3 components, each in its own directory:

-database: our custom database that stores copies of streetview panoramas, panorama metadata, and tags.
-fcgi: the web service that we run on an Amazon Elastic Cloud instance.
-python: the Google Street View mockup that interacts with our web service to allow users to tag panoramas.

For more information on each, see the README files located in each directory.


========== Building ==========

The database and web service are written in C++, compliant with the new 2011 standard.
Makefiles are included that attempt to build these projects using g++.
Make sure that you have the most recent version of g++ (g++-4.7 as of June 30),
as older versions don't recognize some necessary c++11 features.
There are also a few places where you may have to change hardcoded paths.
These places are listed in the directory specific READMEs.

June 30 Note: The python application here is out of date.
I have not updated it to reflect recent changes to the database/webservice;
as soon as this is done I'll push the changes to the repository.
