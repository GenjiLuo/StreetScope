========== June 2012 - streetview project database ==========

Dependencies:
libcurl
ImageMagick++


Building:
An up to date version of g++ is required, so that the -std=c++11 option is available.

Running make will build all the object files and the main executable.
The main executable is only rarely used for global tasks (for instance I've used it to
update the format of our saved data) and can normally be ignored.

Running make lib will pack the necessary object files into a static library.
This is the library that our web service links to, so don't forget to build it as well!

As long as the required libraries are in g++'s library path, you shouldn't have to modify
the makefile for your machine. However, should you want to use main.cpp you will have to
make sure that the paths to the panorama directory and metadata directory are correct
for your machine.
