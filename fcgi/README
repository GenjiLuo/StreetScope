========== July 2013 - streetview project web service ==========

Dependencies:
- our database library (run "make; make lib" in the mongo directory)
- libcurl
- ImageMagick++
- cgicc (libcgicc5-dev)
- libfcgi (libfcgi-dev)
- libfcgi++


Building:
An up to date version of g++ is required, so that the -std=c++11 option is available.
Running make will produce an executable bin/main.fcgi. This executable is invoked as
a fastcgi script by Apache on our Amazon EC2 instance.


As long as the required libraries are in g++'s library path, you shouldn't have to modify
the makefile for your machine. The database paths hardcoded in main.cpp are correct for
our EC2 instance.
