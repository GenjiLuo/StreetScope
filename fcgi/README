========== June 2012 - streetview project web service ==========

Dependencies:
our database library (run "make; make lib" in the database directory)

Dependencies:
libcurl
ImageMagick++
libfcgi
libfcgi++
cgicc


Building:
An up to date version of g++ is required, so that the -std=c++11 option is available.
Running make will produce an executable bin/main.fcgi. This executable is invoked as
a fastcgi script by Apache on our Amazon EC2 instance.


As long as the required libraries are in g++'s library path, you shouldn't have to modify
the makefile for your machine. The database paths hardcoded in main.cpp are correct for
our EC2 instance.
