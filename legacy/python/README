Legacy Street View Python Demo
==============================

The very first code written for the Street View project was essentially a Google Street View mockup written in Python by Zak Stone and Danny Zhu in Fall 2011.
In 2012, Erik Strand updated the Python code to interact with a cloud-based database to permanently store Street View panoramas and metadata.
Now this code has been replaced by a WebGL-based tagging web app, and is no longer maintained.
It can no longer successfully communicate with our cloud database.

How to run the Street View demo
-------------------------------
- After installation, run the following commands in the main project directory with a CACHE_DIR of your choosing:

python street_view_sphere.py [CACHE_DIR]

- Press 'j' to advance along the route, 'k' to go backwards once you are on the route
- Press 'e' when on the route to enhance the current image
- Click and drag with the primary mouse button to look around
- Click with the secondary mouse button to move off the route in the direction of the nearest panorama
- Press 's' to toggle the display of the spheres indicating adjacent panoramas
- Press ESC to exit
