========== July 2013 - streetview project database ==========

Dependencies:
- Boost (system, thread, filesystem, and program_options modules)
- ImageMagick++
- libcurl
- MongoDB

The Makefile assumes that the MongoDB headers can be found in /usr/local/include/mongo.

Running make without any arguments builds all objects and main.cpp.
Running "make lib" builds the library that is used by the web service.

In Database.cpp we assume that the MongoDB instance is running on localhost.
